;; The removed Rust `kotoba-graph::commit` (an append-only, parent-linked chain
;; of `Commit{root, index_roots, prev, seq}` blocks -- "the CommitDag IS the
;; write-ahead log", per ADR-2606041151) had no CLJC successor. This is that
;; primitive, deliberately decoupled from any particular index structure: a
;; commit wraps an opaque, dag-cbor-encodable `state` value -- today that's
;; typically a single `kotoba-lang/prolly-tree` root CID string, and once Wave
;; 2's 5-index Arrangement lands it can just as well be a map of
;; `{"eavt" cid "aevt" cid ...}` -- this namespace never looks inside `state`,
;; it only chains and verifies it. See ADR-2607022600 (Wave 1/2).
;;
;; Storage is injected the same way `prolly-tree.core` does it: `put!` (cid,
;; bytes -> ignored) and `get-fn` (cid -> bytes), so a caller building on both
;; libraries shares one block store without any adapter glue.

;; `prev` is a REAL tag-42 IPLD link (null at genesis) via kotoba-lang/ipld --
;; this replaced the first landing's plain-CID-string ("" at genesis) encoding;
;; every commit CID changed (clean break, pre-production, see superproject ADR).
;; `state` stays opaque: a plain value passes through untouched, and a caller
;; that wants its state's references walkable simply puts `ipld/link` values
;; inside it (kotobase-engine links its quad-store snapshot CID this way).
