;; chain.core — parent-linked, content-addressed commit chain.
;;
;; Renamed from `commit-dag` (ADR-2607050800): "chain" names what this
;; actually is -- a parent-linked chain of commits -- and lines up cleanly
;; with this namespace's own `chain`/`verify-chain`/`head` functions, without
;; the collision `log` would have had with the unrelated, already-existing
;; `kotoba-lang/log` (structured logging/telemetry, `kotoba.lang.log`).
;; Deliberately decoupled from any particular index structure: a commit
;; wraps an opaque, dag-cbor-encodable `state` value -- today that's
;; typically a single `kotoba-lang/prolly-tree` root CID string, or
;; `kotoba-lang/arrangement`'s 4-index roots as a map of
;; `{"eavt" cid "aevt" cid ...}` -- this namespace never looks inside
;; `state`, it only chains and verifies it. See ADR-2607022600 (Wave 1/2).
;;
;; Storage is injected the same way `prolly-tree.core` does it: `put!` (cid,
;; bytes -> ignored) and `get-fn` (cid -> bytes), so a caller building on both
;; libraries shares one block store without any adapter glue.

;; `prev` is a REAL tag-42 IPLD link (null at genesis) via kotoba-lang/ipld --
;; this replaced the first landing's plain-CID-string ("" at genesis) encoding;
;; every commit CID changed (clean break, pre-production, see superproject ADR).
;; `state` stays opaque: a plain value passes through untouched, and a caller
;; that wants its state's references walkable simply puts `ipld/link` values
;; inside it (kotobase-peer links its arrangement snapshot CID this way).

   original `(last (chain get-fn cid))`: `chain`'s loop conses each ancestor
   onto the FRONT of its accumulator and starts from `cid` itself, so `cid`'s
   own commit-info is always the LAST element chain returns; `head` used to
   pay for the whole walk just to hand back the first thing it read. Reading
   the current state on every write (ADR-2607032430 D1's novelty-log commit!)
   made this the hot path — an O(N) chain-length read on every O(tx) write
   would have defeated the point."
